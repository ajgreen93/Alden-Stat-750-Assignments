Neither the visuals generated by plotting the multi-dimensional scaling coordinates, nor the rastered version of the dist
ance matrix, show a great deal of clustering within music or within art. There are several possibilities as to why. One
could be that there are a few outliers (i.e. those with a large number of words in the case of squared distance) which
are throwing off the scale for the plots. This can clearly be seen in plots of both kinds. Another is that we simply haven't
chosen the appropriate distance. Finally, it could be that bag of words is not subtle enough to detect differences between
art and music, which after all are somewhat similar topics.
